# Client-Side Multi-Download Example

A lightweight, client-side web application for downloading multiple files and packaging them into a single ZIP archive - all in the browser without server-side processing.

## Features

- üì¶ **Batch Download**: Select and download multiple files from a remote server
- üóúÔ∏è **On-the-fly ZIP Creation**: Files are compressed and packaged in real-time
- üíæ **Memory Efficient**: Uses streaming to handle large files without memory issues
- üìä **Real-time Progress**: Live progress tracking with detailed file-by-file updates
- üåê **Cross-Browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
- ‚ö° **Instant Download**: Download starts immediately with visible progress
- üîí **Client-Side Only**: No server-side processing required - everything runs in the browser

## Pre-Requirements

A **server hosting test files with a file list** is required. The server must:
- Provide an `index.txt` file containing a list of available files (one filename per line)
- Host the actual files referenced in `index.txt`
- Have CORS enabled to allow browser access

**Example Setup:**
The [uncompressableTestfiles](https://github.com/fabianschwamborn/uncompressableTestfiles) repository can be used to quickly set up a test file server with appropriate test files.

## Technology Stack

- **Pure JavaScript** (Vanilla JS - no frameworks)
- **fflate** - Fast compression library for ZIP creation
- **StreamSaver.js** - Enables true streaming downloads in all browsers
- **File System Access API** - Native browser API for modern browsers (with fallback)

## How It Works

1. Fetches a file list from a remote server (`index.txt`)
2. User selects files to download via checkboxes
3. Downloads files sequentially using streaming
4. Compresses files on-the-fly using fflate
5. Streams the ZIP archive directly to disk using StreamSaver.js
6. Shows real-time progress for each file and overall completion

## Usage

1. Open `website/index.html` in a web browser
2. Wait for the file list to load
3. Select the files you want to download
4. Click "Ausgew√§hlte Dateien herunterladen"
5. Choose where to save the ZIP file
6. Watch the progress as files are downloaded and compressed

## Configuration

The application is configured to fetch files from:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://testfiles.xxip.de/';
const INDEX_URL = API_BASE_URL + 'index.txt';
```

When using a custom server:
1. Files are hosted on a CORS-enabled server
2. An `index.txt` file is created with one filename per line
3. The `API_BASE_URL` in `index.html` is updated accordingly

## Server Configuration Requirements

### CORS and Cache Headers

When hosting the application on a different domain than the file server, **both CORS and cache-control headers must be properly configured**. These headers are equally critical for reliable operation, especially during testing.

‚ö†Ô∏è The following configurations are provided as brief reminders for testing; when files are served, server response headers (CORS and cache-control) shall be configured to match the real deployment and be optimized for the intended use case (for example, by enabling efficient browser caching with ETag/Last-Modified and appropriate Cache-Control directives).

**Required Server Response Headers:**

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://playground.xxip.de
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, Content-Range
Access-Control-Max-Age: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

**Header Essentials:**
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - Specify exact origin (e.g., `https://playground.xxip.de`)
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` - Exposes `Content-Length` for progress tracking
- `Access-Control-Max-Age: 0` - **Critical**: Prevents CORS preflight caching during testing
- `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store` - **Critical**: Prevents file content caching during testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Browser Caching Issues

**Both CORS headers AND file content are aggressively cached by browsers**, causing severe testing problems:

**Common Cache-Related Problems:**
1. **CORS Preflight Caching:**
   - Browsers cache CORS decisions for seconds to hours (default `Access-Control-Max-Age`)
   - Server CORS changes don't take effect until cache expires
   - Results in persistent CORS errors despite correct server configuration

2. **File Content Caching:**
   - Updated `index.txt` not reflected (shows old file list)
   - Modified test files not re-downloaded
   - `Content-Length` mismatches break progress calculation

3. **Combined Effect:**
   - Even with fresh file content, cached CORS headers block access
   - File list (`index.txt`) particularly problematic: content AND CORS both cached
   - Changes invisible until both caches clear

**Symptoms:**
- Application works, then fails with CORS errors after server reconfiguration
- File list doesn't update despite server changes
- Intermittent "No CORS headers" errors with correct server config
- Different behavior across browsers/sessions

**Testing Solutions:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Private/Incognito mode** - Bypasses all browser caches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Set both `Access-Control-Max-Age: 0` AND `Cache-Control: no-cache`** - Prevents both types of caching
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear browser cache completely** before testing configuration changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enable "Disable cache" in DevTools Network tab** during development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify headers with `curl -I`** to confirm server-side configuration

**Production Configuration:**
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://playground.xxip.de
Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```
- Increase `Access-Control-Max-Age` for performance (e.g., 3600 seconds)
- Use long cache times for immutable content
- Consider filename versioning (e.g., `file-v1.dat`) for cache busting

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Firefox 90+ (StreamSaver)
- ‚úÖ Edge 89+ (File System Access API + StreamSaver)
- ‚úÖ Safari 15+ (StreamSaver)

## File Structure

```

## Memory Efficiency

The application uses streaming techniques to handle files of any size:
- Files are downloaded in chunks
- Chunks are immediately compressed
- Compressed data is streamed directly to disk
- Memory usage stays constant regardless of file size

This allows downloading hundreds of MB or even GB of files without running out of memory!
