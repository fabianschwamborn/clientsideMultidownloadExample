# Client-Side Multi-Download Example

A lightweight, client-side web application for downloading multiple files and packaging them into a single ZIP archive - all in the browser without server-side processing.

## Important Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Code Design Philosophy**: This codebase prioritizes comprehensive debugging and testing capabilities over code readability. The implementation includes extensive debug options (force fallback modes, manual method selection, verbose logging) to facilitate testing of various fallback scenarios and edge cases. This results in more complex control flow than a production-focused implementation would require.

## Features

- üì¶ **Batch Download**: Select and download multiple files from a remote server
- üóúÔ∏è **On-the-fly ZIP Creation**: Files are compressed and packaged in real-time
- üíæ **Memory Efficient**: Uses streaming to handle large files without memory issues
- üìä **Real-time Progress**: Live progress tracking with detailed file-by-file updates
- üåê **Cross-Browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
- ‚ö° **Instant Download**: Download starts immediately with visible progress
- üîí **Client-Side Only**: No server-side processing required - everything runs in the browser

## Pre-Requirements

A **server hosting test files with a file list** is required. The server must:
- Provide an `index.txt` file containing a list of available files (one filename per line)
- Host the actual files referenced in `index.txt`
- Have CORS enabled to allow browser access

**Example Setup:**
The [uncompressableTestfiles](https://github.com/fabianschwamborn/uncompressableTestfiles) repository can be used to quickly set up a test file server with appropriate test files.

## Technology Stack

- **Pure JavaScript** (Vanilla JS - no frameworks)
- **fflate** - Fast compression library for ZIP creation
- **StreamSaver.js** - Enables true streaming downloads in all browsers
- **File System Access API** - Native browser API for modern browsers (with fallback)

## How It Works

1. Fetches a file list from a remote server (`index.txt`)
2. User selects files to download via checkboxes
3. Downloads files sequentially using streaming
4. Compresses files on-the-fly using fflate
5. Streams the ZIP archive directly to disk using StreamSaver.js
6. Shows real-time progress for each file and overall completion

## Usage

1. Open `website/index.html` in a web browser
2. Wait for the file list to load
3. Select files to download using checkboxes
4. Click "Download Selected Files"
5. Choose where to save the ZIP file (if using File System API)
6. Monitor progress as files are downloaded and compressed

## Configuration

The application is configured to fetch files from:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://testfiles.xxip.de/';
const INDEX_URL = API_BASE_URL + 'index.txt';
```

When using a custom server:
1. Files are hosted on a CORS-enabled server
2. An `index.txt` file is created with one filename per line
3. The `API_BASE_URL` in `index.html` is updated accordingly

## Server Configuration Requirements

### CORS and Cache Headers

When hosting the application on a different domain than the file server, **both CORS and cache-control headers must be properly configured**. These headers are equally critical for reliable operation, especially during testing.

‚ö†Ô∏è The following configurations are provided as brief reminders for testing; when files are served, server response headers (CORS and cache-control) shall be configured to match the real deployment and be optimized for the intended use case (for example, by enabling efficient browser caching with ETag/Last-Modified and appropriate Cache-Control directives).

**Required Server Response Headers:**

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://playground.xxip.de
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, Content-Range
Access-Control-Max-Age: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

**Header Essentials:**
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - Specify exact origin (e.g., `https://playground.xxip.de`)
- `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` - Exposes `Content-Length` for progress tracking
- `Access-Control-Max-Age: 0` - **Critical**: Prevents CORS preflight caching during testing
- `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store` - **Critical**: Prevents file content caching during testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Browser Caching Issues

**Both CORS headers AND file content are aggressively cached by browsers**, causing severe testing problems:

**Common Cache-Related Problems:**
1. **CORS Preflight Caching:**
   - Browsers cache CORS decisions for seconds to hours (default `Access-Control-Max-Age`)
   - Server CORS changes don't take effect until cache expires
   - Results in persistent CORS errors despite correct server configuration

2. **File Content Caching:**
   - Updated `index.txt` not reflected (shows old file list)
   - Modified test files not re-downloaded
   - `Content-Length` mismatches break progress calculation

3. **Combined Effect:**
   - Even with fresh file content, cached CORS headers block access
   - File list (`index.txt`) particularly problematic: content AND CORS both cached
   - Changes invisible until both caches clear

**Symptoms:**
- Application works, then fails with CORS errors after server reconfiguration
- File list doesn't update despite server changes
- Intermittent "No CORS headers" errors with correct server config
- Different behavior across browsers/sessions

**Testing Solutions:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Private/Incognito mode** - Bypasses all browser caches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Set both `Access-Control-Max-Age: 0` AND `Cache-Control: no-cache`** - Prevents both types of caching
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear browser cache completely** before testing configuration changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Enable "Disable cache" in DevTools Network tab** during development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify headers with `curl -I`** to confirm server-side configuration

**Production Configuration:**
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://playground.xxip.de
Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```
- Increase `Access-Control-Max-Age` for performance (e.g., 3600 seconds)
- Use long cache times for immutable content
- Consider filename versioning (e.g., `file-v1.dat`) for cache busting

## Memory Efficiency

The application uses streaming techniques to handle files of any size:
- Files are downloaded in chunks
- Chunks are immediately compressed
- Compressed data is streamed directly to disk
- Memory usage stays constant regardless of file size

This allows downloading hundreds of MB or even GB of files without running out of memory!

## Download Strategy

The application uses a progressive fallback strategy, prioritizing user convenience and memory efficiency. The strategy differs based on whether a single file or multiple files are selected.

### Single File Downloads (No ZIP)
**Single files are never packaged in a ZIP archive**

When only one file is selected, the application downloads it directly with a "singlefile_" prefix using a separate code path:

**If "Force Blob Fallback" is enabled:**
- Uses blob method immediately (ignores the three-mode strategy)

**Otherwise, progressive fallback:**
1. **File System Access API** (if user enabled + Chrome/Edge desktop)
   - User selects save location via dialog
   - File streamed directly to chosen location
   - Memory-efficient streaming

2. **StreamSaver.js** (if File System API not requested or failed)
   - Direct streaming download without dialog
   - Service worker handles streaming to disk
   - Memory-efficient streaming

3. **Blob Method** (last resort if streaming fails)
   - **Mode 1 (No Fallback)**: File downloaded directly, original filename kept (CORS prevents renaming)
   - **Mode 2 (Automatic, recommended)**: File size checked - small files loaded as blob for renaming, large files downloaded directly to avoid crash risk (original filename)
   - **Mode 3 (Forced)**: File always loaded as blob (enables renaming to "singlefile_" prefix) regardless of size - may crash with large files.

### Multiple File Downloads (ZIP Creation)

When multiple files are selected, the application attempts to create a ZIP archive:

**Primary Method: Streaming ZIP Creation**
When "Force Blob Fallback" is NOT enabled:

1. **File System Access API** (Chrome/Edge desktop, user choice)
   - User selects save location via dialog
   - Files streamed and compressed on-the-fly
   - ZIP archive created directly to disk
   - Memory-efficient, works with any size
   - Files packaged with "batchload_" prefix

2. **StreamSaver.js** (Firefox, Safari, mobile, or fallback)
   - Direct streaming download without dialog
   - Service worker handles streaming to disk
   - ZIP archive created on-the-fly
   - Memory-efficient, works with any size
   - Files packaged with "batchload_" prefix

**Blob Fallback Strategy**

**Mode 1: No Fallback** (Individual Downloads)
- Downloads each file separately, in parallel
- Direct browser downloads (no blob, no ZIP)
- **CORS Limitation**: Files keep original names - cannot add "fallback_X_" prefix
- Minimal memory usage, works with any total size
- Fastest for large batches
- Trade-off: Files not packaged in ZIP, original filenames only

**Mode 2: Automatic Fallback** (Size-Based) - **Recommended**
- Checks total file size before download
- **If ‚â§ 101 MiB**: Creates ZIP via blob (packaged, moderate memory usage)
- **If > 101 MiB**: Downloads individually (no ZIP, original names, safe)
- Balances user convenience with browser stability
- Automatic decision based on measured file sizes

**Mode 3: Forced Blob ZIP**
- Always creates ZIP via blob method regardless of size
- **Warning**: High memory usage, may crash browser with large files
- Use only for small batches (<100 MiB) or when ZIP packaging is critical
- Files packaged with "batchload_" prefix

### Cross-Origin Security Note
Browser security (CORS) prevents renaming files from different domains without loading them into memory (blob). Direct streaming downloads preserve original filenames. To rename files, blob conversion is required, which consumes memory proportional to file size.
